# ALX Backend Python
This repository contains my solutions and practice projects for the **ALX Backend Python module**, spanning both the **ALX Software Engineering program** and the **ALX Backend ProDev program**. It explores advanced backend concepts in Python, including generators, decorators, and more.

## Contents
1. **python_generators-0x01**: Introduction to Python generators, focusing on lazy evaluation, `yield`, and memory-efficient iteration.

2. **python_decorators-0x02**: Practical exercises on Python decorators, covering higher-order functions, closures, and advanced function wrapping.

## Naming Conventions
- **ALX Software Engineering**: `0x0X-project_name`
- **ALX Backend ProDev**: `project_name-0x0X`
