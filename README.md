# ALX Backend Python
This repository contains my solutions and practice projects for the **ALX Backend Python module**, spanning both the **ALX Software Engineering program** and the **ALX Backend ProDev program**. It explores advanced backend concepts in Python, including generators, decorators, and more.

## Contents
1. **python_generators-0x00**: Introduction to Python generators, focusing on lazy evaluation, `yield`, and memory-efficient iteration.

2. **python_decorators-0x01**: Practical exercises on Python decorators, covering higher-order functions, closures, and advanced function wrapping.

3. **python_context_async-perations-0x02**: Working with context managers, managing resources safely using `__enter__` and `__exit__`, asynchronous programming with `async`/`await`, concurrency with `asyncio`, and database operations with `aiosqlite`.
